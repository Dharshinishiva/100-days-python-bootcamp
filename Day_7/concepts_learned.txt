Great question! Since you understood the code, now let's break down **what core Python concepts** you actually practiced and learned from this project:

---

### âœ… **1. Variables & Data Types**

You used different types:

* `int` (like `lives`, `chosen_word`)
* `str` (like `placeholder`, `guess`, `display`)
* `list` (like `words`, `crtt_letter`)

---

### âœ… **2. Random Module**

```python
import random
chosen = random.choice(words)
```

* You learned how to randomly pick an item from a list using `random.choice()`.

---

### âœ… **3. Loops**

#### ðŸ”¹ `for` loop:

Used to create placeholders and to check each letter in the word:

```python
for letter in chosen:
```

#### ðŸ”¹ `while` loop:

Keeps the game running until it's over:

```python
while not game_over:
```

---

### âœ… **4. Conditionals (`if-else`)**

You checked:

* if the guessed letter is correct
* if itâ€™s already guessed
* if lives are over
* if the game is won

---

### âœ… **5. String Operations**

* String concatenation: `display += letter` or `"_ "`
* String methods: `.lower()` to handle case-sensitivity

---

### âœ… **6. Lists**

* Appending: `crtt_letter.append(guess)`
* Checking membership: `if letter in crtt_letter`
* Looping through a list (`for letter in chosen`)

---

### âœ… **7. User Input**

```python
guess = input("guess a letter:").lower()
```

You learned how to:

* take user input
* process it (convert to lowercase)

---

### âœ… **8. Game Logic / Control Flow**

* Keeping track of game state (`game_over`)
* Counting lives
* Deciding when to end the game (`win` or `lose`)

---

### âœ… **9. Debugging & Output Formatting**

From the issues you had (e.g. display showing only 3 letters), you learned:

* How logic bugs affect output
* Importance of formatting (like spacing in strings)

---

### ðŸŒ± **Bonus Skills You Started Using:**

* Thinking like a developer (step-by-step flow)
* Managing multiple conditions and states
* Identifying and fixing small bugs

---

If you want, I can give you **a small challenge based on this** to test what you learned. Want to try it?
